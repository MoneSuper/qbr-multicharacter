Thanks to AndyUK: https://github.com/Andyauk

A reskin/rework look for the qbr-multicharacter latest versionm.

with starting items - 1x apple, 1x water_bottle, 1x bandage, 1x painkillers, 1x cigarette, 1x weapon_melee_knife.
You can change these items server/main.lua

with KyroWasHere - added trigger call to qbr-spawn to get first time/mute "survivalist tip" sound.
local isChossing = true/false

and MoneSuper snippets from there view.
